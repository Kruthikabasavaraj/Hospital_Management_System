Step 1: Setup MySQL and Create Tables
Download and Install MySQL:

Download MySQL from MySQL Downloads and install it on your system.
Make sure to note down your MySQL root username and password during the installation process.
Install MySQL Workbench (optional but recommended):

Download and install MySQL Workbench from the same page if you prefer a graphical interface to manage MySQL databases.
Create Database and Tables:

Launch MySQL Workbench or use MySQL command line to connect to MySQL server (mysql -u root -p).

Create a database (e.g., hospital_management):
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE hospital_management;
Switch to the database:

sql
Copy code
USE hospital_management;
Create tables for patient, doctor, and appointment. Here's a basic schema:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE patient (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE doctor (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    specialty VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE appointment (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_id INT NOT NULL,
    doctor_id INT NOT NULL,
    appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patient(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctor(id)
);
Insert Data (optional):

Insert some sample data into the tables to work with in your Java application.
Step 2: Configure IntelliJ IDEA
Create a New Java Project:

Open IntelliJ IDEA and create a new Java project.
Add MySQL Connector/J Dependency:
Connect IntelliJ IDEA to MySQL:

Open IntelliJ IDEA and go to View > Tool Windows > Database.
Click on the + icon and choose Data Source > MySQL.
Configure the connection with your MySQL server details (host, port, username, password, database).
Step 3: Write and Run Java Program
Create Java Classes:

Create Java classes to represent Patient, Doctor, Appointment, and a Main class for your program logic.
Write JDBC Code:

Use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to MySQL from your Java application. Hereâ€™s a basic example of connecting to MySQL and executing a query:

Run the Program:

Run your Java program within IntelliJ IDEA. Ensure your MySQL server is running and your database connection details (URL, username, password) are correct.
